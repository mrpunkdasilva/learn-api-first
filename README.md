# Learn API-First

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing API-First development.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to serve as a practical guide for developers who want to adopt the API-First approach. Here, you will find examples of OpenAPI specifications, detailed documentation, and best practices for designing and building robust and scalable APIs.

## Documentation

The complete project documentation is available on [our website](https://mrpunkdasilva.github.io/learn-api-first/).

It was created with [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/), a powerful tool for creating technical documentation. To view or edit the documentation locally, open the `Writerside` folder in [JetBrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/).

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a text editor and, optionally, a tool to visualize the OpenAPI specification, such as the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8357-openapi-swagger-editor) plugin.
